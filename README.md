# cloudDemo
Create a demo environment using cloud tools in Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform and CI/CD.

This is a simple project to showcase a demo environment that simulates how one would run in a cloud-native demo. It uses a simple python web app, runs it on Kubernetes that uses a Docker container, sets up a ci/cd pipeline and uses it to validate. Added files to stand up infra by either Terraform or Kubectl. This runs locally on a computer for cost-free purposes as this is just a showcase of common Cloud Engineer work.
